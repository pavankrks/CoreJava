>> Interface is like a contract where the implementation need functionality
in order to achive standardization

>>Ploymorphism plays an importtant role in interface,we are overriding the
method implemented in interface,this helps to achive Code reduction,and performance

>>Interface is a collection of abstract classes and members

>>Class need to be declare as abstract if we cant provide the functionality
to interface methods

>>Interface cant implement interface

>>Class can implement interface

>>Multiple inheritance is possible through interface,Because there is no \
diamond shape problem

>>Interface can extend another iterface

>>A class can extend class and implement interface at the same time

>>The varialbes are public static final in interface
